[Maine Department of Education](https://www.maine.gov/doe/home) is the first OSC member to submit to the CEDS Data Warehouse Parquet project.  They have contributed development effort and have field tested the CEDS Data Warehouse Parquet standard through their SLDS redesign project.

The [Center for the Integration of IDEA Data](https://ciidta.grads360.org/#program) (CIID), through a grant from the [Office of Special Education Programs](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/osep/index.html), created the CEDS Data Warehouse with the development of [Generate](https://ciidta.grads360.org/#program/generate). Generate, an ED*Facts* reporting application, began by using the CEDS Integrated Data Store (IDS) to integrate data from multiple sources for EDFacts reporting but needed the ability to retrieve data quickly out of the system which prompted the first iteration of the CEDS Data Warehouse. For several years, under CIID through the Generate application, the CEDS Data Warehouse was field tested. The [Nevada Department of Education](http://www.doe.nv.gov/) was the pilot state for Generate and assisted in several iterations, updates, and enhancements to Generate. Their efforts, along with other states implementing Generate, helped the CIID team improve the CEDS Data Warehouse structure.  This structure became the basis for the CEDS Data Warehouse Parquet standard.

In the next few years, CEDS will continue to work with stakeholders to find ways to bring the community together. The CEDS team is excited to continue to partner with you, the community, in this new era.
